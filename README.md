# 🚀 Road to Full-Stack Web Development

Hi, I’m Limirex, Beye Livingstone Changko, in full 👋🏽  
Welcome to my journey into full-stack web development! This repository is where I document everything I’m learning as a self-taught developer—starting from the basics of HTML, CSS, and beyond.

## 🛠️ What This Repo Contains

This is a collection of practice projects, mini challenges, and learning milestones from my daily studies.  
Each folder represents a different topic or stage of my growth.

### 📁 Structure
- `/HTML Projects/` – My beginner projects while learning HTML fundamentals
- `/CSS Styling/` – Styling exercises and layouts (coming soon!)
- Future folders will include:
  - JavaScript challenges
  - Responsive design projects
  - Backend (Node.js, databases)
  - Full-stack projects

## 💡 Why I Made This
I'm passionate about web development and committed to becoming a full-stack developer.  
This repo holds me accountable, shows my progress, and maybe even helps someone else who’s learning too.

## 📈 My Progress So Far
- ✅ Learned HTML basics (elements, forms, tables, etc.)
- ⏳ Currently learning CSS styling
- 🔜 Starting JavaScript soon

## 🙌🏽 Let’s Connect!
If you’re also learning, or just want to chat dev stuff, feel free to connect with me or drop feedback.  
I'm always open to learning from others too!
